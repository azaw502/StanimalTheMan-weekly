I am Stan Choi and am currently a senior at NYU.  I am majoring in Computer Science and do not know exactly what I am interested in sadly.

### More Information

I like **baseball** and my favorite MLB team is the **New York Mets.**  Perhaps I want to deal with Statcast as spin rates and exit velocities do make me wonder if they do matter much.
