# My Thoughts on HFOSS
I think the concept of using open source software in projects for social good and with humanitarian goals in mind is great as described in Chamindra de Silva's article.  Open source belongs so smoothly as the freedoms and practices align to principles in the humanitarian domain.  However, I think it is harder to get involved as they might not have time to help you set up the code environment for example as emergencies etc. prompt immediate responses.  Furthermore, my project evaluation below will show the rather infrequent activity of a HFOSS project.  I know my sample size is almost nil as I've only evaluated one such project, but it seems as though it is not as easy to contribute to as big open source projects such as React, Python, and other frameworks, tools we use daily.  

In terms of prestige, I am ambivalent.  On one hand, there certainly is admiration for making the world a better place.  However, it may be harder to enter and more pressure may be on you as lives may depend on you.  Less activity and less help may make the project not appeal to the masses as general open source projects that involve more of the community in terms of improving the code etc. and gain more prestige as a result.

I do not know.  I like the idea of helping those in need.  Only time can tell as I have to build my skill set despite articles out there saying how anyone can contribute to HFOSS with the right mindset.



# Project Evaluation
While I may be older and was never actually at a shelter, I came relatively closish as I, having called only my poor father and a younger brother as my only remaining family the past 5+ years, had constant stress from poverty and eviction notices for not paying rent, etc.  Thus, while I can't imagine the stress of actually being homeless, I am evaluating a project that embodies the topic of homelessness which may turn out to be something I might want to possibly get into via open source in my life sometime.
