While I may be older and was never actually at a shelter, I came relatively closish as I, having called only my poor father and a younger brother as my only remaining family the past 5+ years, had constant stress from poverty and eviction notices for not paying rent, etc.  Thus, while I can't imagine the stress of actually being homeless, I am evaluating a project that embodies the topic of homelessness which may turn out to be something I might want to possibly get into via open source in my life sometime.

## Summary assesment
__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__  Neutral; I think it might be hard if one is completely new to programming.  While one can bring up questions like how to use Pandas in scientific articles or ask for clarification on errors, it seems more beneficial for those who are more intermediate or advanced with Pandas, Python, etc.


__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__ Yes, at least one of them, **jreback** does so.


__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes.



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes
