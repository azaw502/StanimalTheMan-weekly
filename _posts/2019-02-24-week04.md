I chose to evaluate the __Pandas__ library because while I am a noob at everything cs related, I do have an interest in **baseball
and stats** like **_velocity, spin rates, exit velocities_**, etc.  I have not used math in ages since coming to college, but
recently, I nonetheless tried to look into the Pandas library in an effort to learn some **_data visualization skills_** that can
come in handy for **_data analysis, statistical analysis, and possibly machine learning analysis_**.  Maybe, I can defy the odds and relearn the math and other skills I need and try to enter the realms of data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence someday.  Pandas seems to be handy...
