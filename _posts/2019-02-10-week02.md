### My Own Contributions
So far, most of the commits have been from me.  I wrote some javascript and added the season gifs aside from the summer theme.  I have something working based on simple web extension examples.  However, Will, a member is trying to make the theme more ostensible to the eye by using CSS and will commit soon.  

### Current State of Extension
I am having a hard time not completely basing off other extensions.  I cannot extend the theme across the entire header using browser.theme.  For some reason, we as a group are having a hard time making the theme more apparent. When I try to change the property names, "images" and "headerURL" in the seasonalThemes object, the extension does not even work.  We probably do not know how extensions work well and are far from being proficient at Javascript?

### What I Learned About Git and Github
Before taking this class, I've had little exposure to git and Github.  I used three commands, git add, git commit -m, and git push in Applied Internet Technology, and for the most part, am still only comfortable using those three lol.  I learned about the concept of branches through the gitruler exercises, the concept of SHA-1 hashes that represent hashes, notion of HEAD, etc.  Unfortunately, due to group conflicts, my group for the git activity did not really get to complete it; I will try to make up for my shortcomings through other git tutorials interactively.
