### My Own Contributions
I laid down the initial javascript file in terms of logic.  I got the theme to display based on date,but I am working on it.

### Current State of Extension
I am having a hard time not completely basing off other extensions.  I cannot extend the theme across the entire header using browser.theme.  For some reason, we as a group are having a hard time making the theme more apparent. When I try to change the property names, "images" and "headerURL" in the seasonalThemes object, the extension does not even work.  We will have something working because Brandon has made the gifs repeat across the header and Will has tried to use CSS.

### What I Learned About Git and Github
Before taking this class, I've had little exposure to git and Github.  I used three commands, git add, git commit -m, and git push in Applied Internet Technology, and for the most part, am still only comfortable using those three lol.  I learned about the concept of branches through the gitruler exercises, the concept of SHA-1 hashes that represent hashes, notion of HEAD, etc.  Unfortunately, due to group conflicts, my group for the git activity did not really get to complete it; I will try to make up for my shortcomings through other git tutorials interactively.
