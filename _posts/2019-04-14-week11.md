# Blog About At Least 2 Given Lessons From Cathedral and Bazaar
1. "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away."
  * I think this means that you should not be scared to delete code or features as functionality might improve or remain just as efficient.  
  Legacy software may hold a special place in your heart but new technology might be just as good if not make things more efficient. 
  More is not always better as the adage goes.
  * I agree with it to the best of my competence because while the software I've written is rather pathetic, I agree that keeping
  everything is not necessary if I can do things more efficiently whether it be faster runtime or less memory storage.  While it 
  may not be relevant as it is not a technical matter, there is something more perfect about a concise poem than a wordy poem;
  the concise poem might get the message across just as well if not better.
  
2. "When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend."
  *  Somewhat contrary to the above, after reading the relevant parts, I think this means that just because something is somewhat
  verbose, what ultimately matters is the users' ability to comprehend the software most easily.  As a result, although I do not
  really know what Turing-complete means, I guess the overall message is to make the software etc. user friendly if it is not
  going to be as efficient and good as being Turing-complete (which is most of the time).
  *  I agree since English might be a little wordy at times, but it is not necessarily bad; being terse is not all that important
  if users have a harder time understanding how to use or what is going on.
