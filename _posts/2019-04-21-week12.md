I found most interesting how Bloomberg's systems produce billions of messages everyday and meet goals using open source tools and 
when the tools do not suffice or people at the company see ways to improve them, they go ahead and do so; contributions
were made to Python etc.  Despite Bloomberg's news and data tech background, I found its involvment with machine learning
quite interesting as well.  The most surprising was that Bloomberg was involved in trying to become in favor of private
fields in Javascript that came to be known as Typescript; I thought Javascript was mainly for web development stuff and did
not see Bloomberg's heavy passion for Javascript.

As for our team project, we do not know if our challenge on testing if a tree is a BST is a good one.  As a result,
we have not submitted a pull request hitherto.  I submitted a grammar and spelling fix for a solution for a React challenge that got
merged but I do not know if it was a team effort as much as my own contribution on the side.  I made an issue regarding data
structures solutions' being in one place but not another in order to better assess our situation as the finish line is looming.
